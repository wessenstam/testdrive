Privilege Elevation: Just Enough Privilege (Infrastructure Services)
********************************************************************
 
This exercise will walk you through Centrify Privilege Elevation Service. You will be able to grant just enough privilege for the users

#. Login as **afoster** in *Centrify* server 
#. Open **Access Manager** and naviagate to *Global Zone > Child Zone > Windows Zone > Computers > APPSERVER > Role Assignment*
#. Check that the **Role Assignment** is as below

   .. figure:: images/lab-002.png

#. If this is not the case, right-click on *Role Assigment* and select **Assign Role...**
#. Select the **Windows - Login Read Events** and select **OK**
#. Add the AD Group *OMICRON_GRP_Helpdesk* and click **OK** 
#. This will have added the group to the *Role Assignments*

#. Log in to the *AppServer* system as *JMiller*
#. When prompted for MFA, select *Security Question*. Answer: **Centrify**
#. Locate **Event Viewer** on the desktop and start it
#. Expand *Windows Logs* and click on **Security**
#. Note that Joe Miller is **unable** to see the Security logs from Event Viewer
#. *Right-click on Event Viewer* and select **Run with privilege**

   .. figure:: images/lab-001.png

#. Expand **Windows Logs** and click on **Security**
#. You will notice that the *Security* logs are now **visible** to you  
#. Without closing the current window, from the desktop, click on *Event Viewer* one more time *but do not run with privilege*. Simply double-click on it. Navigate to the *security* logs and notice that *you lost your privilege*. **The right to see the logs are only applicable when you run with privilege.**


Privilege Elevation: Just-In-Time Privilege (MFA Enabled)
*********************************************************
 
#. Log in to *Centrify* as Alex Foster (**afoster**)
#. Let's give the contractor Laura Bennet (*lbennet*) access to the *CloudVM.localdomain* system. Open the *Admin Portal*
#. Login as **afoster** with the password *Centr1fy*
#. Navigate to *Resources > Systems*
#. Click the *CloudVM.localdomain* system
#. Click **Permissions** and click **Add**
#. In the search bar type *Laura*, select her account **LBennett@omicron..** and click **Add**

   .. figure:: images/lab-004.png

#. Make sure **View** and **AgentAuth** are enabled
#. Click **Save**
#. Log out by clicking the name and select **Sign Out**

   .. figure:: images/lab-003.png

#. Login the portal as **lbennett** with the known password *Centr1fy*
#. Expand *Resources > Systems*
#. Locate *CloudVM.localdomain*, right-click on it and select **Enter Account**
#. Login as **lbennett@omicron.lab** with *Cenr1fy* when prompted for User Name and Password
#. Once you are logged in, issue the command ``cat /etc/shadow``. Notice you do not have rights to see the content of the file.
#. Attempt utilizing the ``sudo cat /etc/shadow`` command and providing all requested follow up security questions, the system is telling that the user is not a part of the sudoers group and therefore, unable to run the command.

   .. figure:: images/lab-005.png

#. Logout of the session by **CTRL+d** and click **Close**
#. Open a Google Chrome *Incognito* screen
#. Open the Admin Portal by typing *centrifymember.omicron.lab* and login as **afoster**
#. Click on *CloudVM.localdomain* and select *Workflow* and set *Privilege Elevation* to **Yes**
#. Once Privilege Elevation is set to yes, confirm **Requestorâ€™s Manager** is the approvers for the request and set *Action if user has no manager* to **Automatically Approve**
#. Click **Save**. Now, users that are not part of the sudoers group, will have the ability to request privilege as needed.

   .. figure:: images/lab-012.png

#. Return to the *first Google Chrome* session where *lbennett* is logged in and click in the right top corner the user name and select **Reload Rights**
#. Log in once again to the *CloudVM.localdomain*
#. Issue ``sudo cat /etc/shadow``
#. Now notice that Laura can elevate privilege based on a request
#. Follow the prompts on your screen and accept all defaults except the last step, Duration for request. Select number 3 [Temporary]. Since the request was automatically approved, user can now issue the command ``sudo cat /etc/shadow``

Permanent Privileged Elevation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
#. Alternatively, we can provision the rights to this user permanently. Return to the tab where you logged in as Afoster and navigate to *Resources > Systems*
#. Click on **CloudVM.localdomain** and then **Privilege Elevation**. Click **Add**
#. Type **lbennett** on the search bar. Select her account and click **Add** at the bottom and click **Save**
#. Log in to the system, as done earlier, and run ``sudo /etc/shadow``. You should see now that the command can be run without approval.
